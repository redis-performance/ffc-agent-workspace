## EXP-001 — 4-digit SWAR follow-up in ffc_loop_parse_if_eight_digits

**Date**: 2026-05-26  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**ffc commit**: cf971fe

### Hypothesis

Numbers with 5–7 significant fractional digits (canada.txt, mesh.txt format) never trigger
the 8-digit SWAR loop in `ffc_loop_parse_if_eight_digits` because `pend - p < 8`. All
digits fall through to byte-by-byte iteration. The existing `ffc_parse_four_digits_unrolled`
and `ffc_is_made_of_four_digits_fast` functions in parse.h were dead code on the hot path.

A 4-digit SWAR follow-up after the 8-digit loop converts 7 byte-by-byte iterations into
1×SWAR-4 + 3 byte-by-byte for 7-digit fractions — roughly 43% fewer digit-scanning operations.
Also fixed a double-read of `ffc_read8_to_u64(*p)` in the 8-digit loop (read-once, use twice).

### Benchmark results

**Baseline** (20260526-161003):

| Dataset | ffc MB/s | fastfloat MB/s | gap |
|---------|----------|----------------|-----|
| random  | 2106     | 2452           | -14% |
| canada  | 1049     | 1480           | -29% |
| mesh    | 836      | 933            | -10% |

**EXP-001, run 1** (20260526-161706):

| Dataset | ffc MB/s | fastfloat MB/s | gap |
|---------|----------|----------------|-----|
| random  | 2081     | 2525           | -18% (noise) |
| canada  | 1354     | 1381           | -2% |
| mesh    | 988      | 1054           | -6% |

**EXP-001, run 2** (20260526-161732):

| Dataset | ffc MB/s | fastfloat MB/s | gap |
|---------|----------|----------------|-----|
| random  | 1977     | 2234           | -12% (noise) |
| canada  | 1676     | 1773           | -5% |
| mesh    | **1095** | **1036**       | **+5% (ffc wins!)** |

### Analysis

- **canada**: +29% absolute gain, gap vs fastfloat closed from -29% to ~-4% (avg of 2 runs)
- **mesh**: +18% absolute gain, gap closed from -10% to ~±0% (within run-to-run noise)
- **random**: No regression — these numbers have 14-17 fractional digits, so the 8-digit SWAR
  was already helping. The 4-digit follow-up adds marginal work (1 extra check + possible
  SWAR-4 after the 8-digit loop); within the 20-40% benchmark variance.
